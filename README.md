# Create-a-Serverless Web Application

## Overview

In this tutorial, I create a simple serverless web application that lets users ride unicorns on WildRydes. The web application provides users with an HTML-based user interface to specify the location where they want to be picked up, and creates an interface on the backend with a RESTful web service to submit the request and provide a nearby unicorn. The application also provides components to allow users to register with the service and sign in before requesting a unicorn ride.
