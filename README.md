# Create-a-Serverless Web Application

## Overview

In this project, I will set up a simple web application that allows users to request unicorn rides from the Wild Rydes fleet. The app has an HTML-based interface that allows users to enter their pickup location and communicate in the background with a RESTful web service to process the request and send the nearest unicorn. The app also includes features that allow users to register and sign in before requesting a ride.

The app was built using a combination of AWS technologies, including Lambda, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, Cognito and Amplify Console. The Amplify Console hosts the static web resources, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images, which are loaded into the user's browser via S3. The JavaScript code executed in the browser communicates with the public backend API created with Lambda and API Gateway to send and receive data. Cognito is responsible for managing and securing user authentication, while DynamoDB provides a persistence layer for storing data generated by the API's Lambda function.

A visual representation of the entire architecture can be found in the diagram below.

## STATIC WEBHOSTING

In this section, I set up the AWS Amplify Console to host the static components of my web application. Later, I'll extend these pages with dynamic functionality using JavaScript to access remote REST APIs built with AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.

### Architecture overview

The architecture of this module is very simple. The AWS Amplify Console and Amazon CloudFront will manage and serve all my static web content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other files. End users can then access your website through the public website URL provided by the AWS Amplify Console. There is no need to run web servers or use other services to make this website available.

## REPOSITORY

I use AWS CodeCommit to host my website's repository. CodeCommit is part of the free AWS offering.

### Setting up my CodeCommit repository

1. First I create a new CodeCommit repository:

`aws codecommit create-repository \
  --repository-name wild-rydes`
  
2. I clone the existing (not new) workshop repository from GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-webapp-workshop.git`

3. I change to the directory of the workshop repository:

`cd aws-serverless-webapp-workshop`
